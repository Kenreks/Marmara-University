#SLIDE 27:Further Exercises
"""
1. Write a function that takes a string and an integer
as input (string, y). The function should print the string y times,
and each time the string should be written in a new line.

e.g: print_str('exercise',3) should return below:
exercise
exercise
exercise

"""
def print_str(my_str,y):
    z=my_str+"\n"
    w=z*y
    print w
print_str('exercise',3)


"""
2. Write a function called percentage that takes the percentage for two given numbers.

e.g: percentage(80,60,25) should return:
25% of 80 is 20.0
25% of 60 is 15.0
"""
def percentage(number1,number2,per):
    first = number1*per/100.0
    second = number2*per/100.0
    print str(per) + "% of " + str(number1) + " is " + str(first)
    print str(per) + "% of " + str(number2) + " is " + str(second)
percentage(80,60,25)

"""
3.Write a function that takes four arguments x1, y1, x2, y2 where each
(x, y) pair refers to a point on a 2D Cartesian plane and prints the distance between the two points
(x1, y1)and(x2, y2). You are encouraged to use functions from the math module.

e.g. cartes(3,4,5,6) should give 2.828
"""
def cartes(x1,y1,x2,y2):
    import math
    distance=math.sqrt((x1-x2)**2+(y1-y2)**2)
    print (distance)
cartes(3,4,5,6)
